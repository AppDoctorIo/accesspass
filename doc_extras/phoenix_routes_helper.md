# Phoenix routes
AccessPass comes with a helper module to generate authentication routes for you like the following.

```elixir
defmodule TestWeb.Router do
  use TestWeb, :router
  use AccessPass.Routes #helper module

  scope "/" do
    access_pass :routes #macro to generate routes
  end

end
```

This will generate the following routes
